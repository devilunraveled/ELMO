\section*{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
In this detailed report, I meticulously document my journey implementing the ELMO model, a cutting-edge technique in natural language processing. Exploring its complex architecture and contextual word embeddings, I navigate through the training process, sharing the methodologies used and challenges faced. Through evaluating its performance across diverse NLP tasks, I highlight both strengths and limitations. 

We also train the model on a downstream classification task, combining the embeddings in several possible ways.

For the learnable function, I use a single hidden layer with relu sigmoid activation.
