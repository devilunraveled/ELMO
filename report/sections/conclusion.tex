Overall, the learable parameter performs better than when the model has fixed parameter, a learnable function also performs well, but isn't as good as the learnable parameter one, and also takes some more time to train due to a larget increase in the number of parameters. 

ELMO architecture, therefore, does outperform previous architectures with similar setting, however, it takes a longer time to train. Therefore, the choice of the underlying model depends on the tasks aat hand.
